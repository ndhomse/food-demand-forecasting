### Capstone: Food Demand Forecasting

**Niranjan Dhomse**

#### Executive summary
A meal delivery company which operates in multiple cities via various fulfillment centers for dispatching meal orders to their customers. The client wants you to help these centers with demand forecasting for upcoming weeks so that these centers will plan the stock of raw materials accordingly.

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?
Without proper demand forecasting processes in place, it can be nearly impossible to have the right amount of stock on hand at any given time.
A food delivery service has to deal with a lot of perishable raw materials which makes it all the more important for such a company to accurately forecast daily and weekly demand.
Too much inventory in the warehouse means more risk of wastage, and not enough could lead to out-of-stocks

#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?

Given the historical data of demand for a product-center combination (Weeks: 1 to 145), the task is to predict the demand for the next 10 weeks (Weeks: 146-155) for the center-meal combinations in the test set.
